# Rails [Tealeaf]
## Database and Model

These are my notes from week 1 of the Rapid Deployment course.

#### Directory Structure
**Assets** hold static files like images, CSS and JS.
**Controllers** are .rb files that like routes to actions. `application_controller.rb` is the parent.
**Helpers** extract common logic used in Views.
**Bin** holds executables like `rake` and `bundle`.
**Config /> Initializers** store apps that your source code can use.
**DB** holds sqlite3 files. If using another DB, this will be empty.
